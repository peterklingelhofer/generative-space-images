# Generative Space Images

Combine and blend random images from the past ten years of NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day with Python.

## Setup

Grab a NASA API key from [here](https://api.nasa.gov/) and assign it to `apiKey` in the code, or continue using `DEMO_KEY` until you run out of requests (capped at 50 at the time of writing this).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peterklingelhofer/nasa.git
cd nasa
python --version
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

```sh
python index.py
```
